# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project very seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them to us immediately following these steps.

**Do NOT disclose the vulnerability publicly.**

**1. Private Disclosure:**
   - Send an email to `security@tabflow.dev` (replace with actual security contact email if available, otherwise use a placeholder or omit this step and rely on GitHub's security advisory system).
   - Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
     - The affected version(s) of the browser extension.
     - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
     - Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots.
     - Your contact information for follow-up.

**2. GitHub Security Advisory (Recommended):**
   - Navigate to the **Security** tab of this repository.
   - Click on **Advisories**.
   - Click **New vulnerability alert** or **Report a vulnerability**.
   - **CRITICAL:** Choose **Keep this vulnerability private** to prevent public disclosure until a fix is ready.
   - Provide all the details requested by GitHub's security advisory system.

## Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**. (Replace with actual SLA if applicable).
- We will investigate the reported vulnerability promptly.
- We will work to develop and release a fix as quickly as possible.
- We will notify the reporter when a fix has been released.
- We may acknowledge your contribution publicly once the vulnerability is resolved (e.g., in release notes or on our website), if you agree.

## Supported Versions

We are actively developing and maintaining the latest version of TabFlow. Security patches will be prioritized for the latest stable release and potentially recent previous releases. Older, unsupported versions may not receive security updates.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We adhere to a responsible disclosure policy. We will not pursue legal action against individuals who report vulnerabilities in good faith and follow the steps outlined above. We encourage ethical security research.
