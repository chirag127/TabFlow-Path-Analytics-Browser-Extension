## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or using uv for Pythonic projects:
    # uv install
    ```

3.  **Build for development:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Load the extension in your browser:**
    Follow your browser's instructions for loading an unpacked extension. Typically, this involves going to `chrome://extensions` (or equivalent) and selecting the `dist` folder generated by the build process.

## 💻 Development

### Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure, separating concerns into `background`, `content`, and `popup` scripts, with shared `service` and `utils` layers. TypeScript is used for type safety, and Vite is employed for efficient bundling.

### Scripts

| Script         | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | 
| `npm run dev`  | Starts the development server with hot-reloading. |
| `npm run build`| Builds the extension for production.             |
| `npm run lint` | Runs the linter (Biome).                         |
| `npm run test` | Executes unit and integration tests (Vitest).    |

### Principles

*   **SOLID:** Adherence to Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Code reuse is prioritized.
*   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Logic is kept straightforward and maintainable.
*   **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Features are only implemented when necessary.

--- 

## 🧪 Testing

TabFlow employs a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability and robustness.

*   **Unit Tests:** Written using Vitest, located in the `tests/` directory, mirroring the source structure.
*   **E2E Tests:** (Future implementation) Playwright will be used for end-to-end scenario validation.
*   **Coverage:** Aiming for 100% test coverage. All production code MUST have corresponding tests.

**To run tests:**
```bash
npm run test
```

## 3. CONTEXT-AWARE APEX TECH STACKS (LATE 2025 STANDARDS)
**Directives:** Detect project type and apply **Apex Toolchain**.
*   **SCENARIO A: WEB / APP / EXTENSION (TypeScript)**
